Speech technologies is one of the evolving and highly demanded area for the past few decades due to the huge progress brought by machine learning technology. Especially the past decade has brought tremendous progress which includes the introduction of conversational agents. Contributes to improving voice embedding through multi-task learning with task generalization and increased accuracy along with the exploration of explainability of the embedding in terms of paralinguistic voice features.
